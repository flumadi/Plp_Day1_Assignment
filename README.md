Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry. software enineering is the process of developing, testing and maintaining software system applications. Imporance of software engineering are; 1.It ensures that software systems are efficient and easily navigatable to the society 2.It drives innovation such that people in technology industry come up with great methodology to assist in problem solving. 3.It enables automation and digital transformation promotig tansition from manual process to digital process. 4.It encourages teamwork that helps techies work more efficiently and swiftly.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering. 1. The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) The term Software Engineering was first introduced at the 1968 NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the "Software Crisis." As software became more complex, traditional hardware-focused engineering approaches failed. This led to the development of structured programming and methodologies to improve software quality and reliability. Its impacs are; -Shifted software development from an informal coding practice to a structured engineering discipline. -Led to the creation of software development life cycle (SDLC) models like Waterfall. 2. The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP); The Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) paradigm gained popularity with languages like C++, Smalltalk, and later Java. OOP introduced concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, making code more reusable and modular. its Impacts are; -Improved software design, maintainability, and scalability. -Became the foundation for modern software development, influencing languages like Python, JavaScript, and Swift. 3. The Agile Revolution (2001); In 2001, software engineers introduced the Agile Manifesto to promote flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback in development. Agile replaced rigid models (like Waterfall) with iterative approaches such as Scrum, Kanban, and Extreme Programming (XP). its Impacts are; Increased adaptability to changing requirements. Became the standard for modern software development, especially in startups, mobile apps, and web development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. The software development life cycle is as follows; 1.Planning - Herer we define the project scope, goals, feasibility, risks, and resource allocation for accountability budgetwise. 2.Analysis - We analyse the situation at hand and check for the necessary requirements to meet the developmet. 3.Design - Here we come up with system architecture, database design and UI/UX layout for the software 4.Coding process - Here we now start making the software system based on the design specifications by invocking codes using appropriate programming languages. 5.Testing and fixing of bugs - Code reviews are done and to identify and fix bugs and ensure the system is running swiftly. 6.Deployment - The tested software is released to the production environment for end-users, either in phases or all at once. 7.Maintanance - This is where the system is maintained to ensure the software remains functional and secure over time.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate. The waterfall model states that a project hasseveral stages—requirements, analysis, design, coding, testing, and maintenance and their implementation is sequential, meaning the next stage cannot be started before theprevious one has been closed, documented, and approved for example a healthcare system requires fixed, structured processes.Agile model is based on the fact that the only thing that does not change is change in other words everything is bound to change for example a school mess hall system thats eccomerce in nature requires continuous improvements based on user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team. 1. Software Developer A Software Developer is responsible for designing, coding, testing, and maintaining software applications. They; -Write clean, efficient, and maintainable code. -Translate user requirements into functional applications. -Collaborate with designers, testers, and other team members. -Ensure software security, scalability, and performance. -Keep up with new technologies and frameworks. 2.Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer A QA Engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards before deployment. They; -Design and execute test plans (manual and automated). -Identify and document software defects. -Perform functional, performance, and security testing. -Ensure compliance with industry standards. -Collaborate with developers to fix issues. 3. Project Manager (PM) A Project Manager oversees the software development process, ensuring timely delivery within budget and scope. They; -Do planning and defining project scope, goals, and deliverables. -Assign tasks and coordinate teams. -Manage risks, timelines, and resources. -Communice with stakeholders and clients. -Ensure the team follows Agile, Waterfall, or other methodologies.**

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each. Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) - is a software suite that provides tools to streamline coding, debugging, and testing in a single interface. its importance; -Enhances Productivity – Features like syntax highlighting, code completion, and debugging tools speed up development. -Reduces Errors – Built-in debugging tools help identify issues early. -Simplifies Code Management – Integrated file explorers and project managers keep code organized. -Supports Multiple Languages & Frameworks – Many IDEs support various programming languages and frameworks. Examples of IDEs: -Visual Studio Code (VS Code) – Lightweight, supports extensions for JavaScript, Python, and more. -PyCharm – Designed specifically for Python development. -Eclipse – Often used for Java and enterprise applications. Version Control Systems (VCS) - is a tool that helps track changes in source code over time, allowing collaboration and rollback to previous versions. its importance ; -Facilitates Team Collaboration – Multiple developers can work on the same project without conflicts. -Tracks Changes & Maintains History – Enables developers to review, revert, or compare previous versions. -Supports Branching & Merging – Developers can work on separate features without affecting the main codebase. -Ensures Code Integrity – Prevents data loss by maintaining backups of previous versions. Examples of VCS: -Git – The most widely used distributed version control system. -GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket – Cloud-based platforms that provide Git repositories for collaborative development. -Subversion (SVN) – A centralized version control system used in legacy systems.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges. 1. Problem-Solving Complexity -Identifying and understanding the problem -Devising and implementing a solution -Ensuring the solution is efficient and scalable 2. Debugging and Troubleshooting -Finding the root cause of errors -Analyzing large amounts of code -Using debugging tools and techniques 3.Collaboration and Communication -Establish clear communication channels -Use collaborative tools and platforms -Foster a culture of open feedback and support -Learn active listening and facilitation skills

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance. 1. Unit Testing -Testing individual components of a software application in isolation. its importance are ; -Verifies the correct functionality of each module. -Detects errors early in the development cycle. -Isolates issues and simplifies debugging. 2.Integration Testing-it is the testing the interaction and collaboration of different components within a system. its importance are; -Ensures that components communicate and work together as expected. -Finds interoperability issues and ensures smooth integration. -Validates the overall flow of the system. 3. System Testing - Testing the complete software system as a whole from a user's perspective -Verifies the overall functionality, performance, and usability of the system. -Simulates real-world scenarios and exposes defects that may not be evident in unit or integration testing. -Ensures the system meets the user's requirements. 4.Acceptance Testing-Testing the system from the perspective of the end-users or stakeholders. -Validates the system against the acceptance criteria and ensures it meets the user's expectations. -Provides confidence to stakeholders that the system is ready for deployment. -Helps identify usability issues and areas for improvement.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models. Prompt engineering refers to the art of crafting input text prompts to optimize the responses generated by AI models. It involves designing prompts that provide the AI model with clear instructions, relevant context, and the desired tone and style of the response. Some of its importance are ; -Improved Output Quality: Well-crafted prompts can guide the AI model towards producing more accurate, informative, and relevant responses. -Control Over Generation: Prompt engineering enables developers to tailor the responses of AI models to meet specific requirements, such as tone, style, length, and content. -Reduced Ambiguity: By providing clear instructions, prompts minimize the chances of the AI model misunderstanding the user's intent, resulting in more consistent and predictable outputs.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Original Vague Prompt: Write a story about a girl and her journey. Improved Clear, Specific, and Concise Prompt: Craft a captivating narrative that follows the poignant journey of a 16-year-old girl named Anya, a budding artist grappling with the complexities of identity, self-expression, and the pursuit of her dreams in the face of societal expectations and familial pressures. Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective: Clear: It specifies the protagonist (Anya), her age (16), and her occupation (budding artist). Specific: It outlines the themes to be explored (identity, self-expression, dreams, societal expectations, familial pressures). Concise: It concisely summarizes the key elements of the story without unnecessary details. By providing this clear, specific, and concise prompt, it guides the writer towards a more focused and compelling narrative. It establishes a clear starting point, defines the protagonist's journey, and sets the stage for a meaningful exploration of the intended themes.
